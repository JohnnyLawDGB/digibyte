# DigiDollar Oracle Operator Guide
*How to become an oracle operator and get your key into DigiByte Core*

---

## Overview

DigiDollar requires oracle operators to provide real-time DGB/USD price feeds. Oracle public keys are **hardcoded in `src/kernel/chainparams.cpp`** — every oracle operator must:

1. Run a current DigiByte Core release (RC30 or later; RC34 is the latest at the time of writing) and create a descriptor wallet
2. Run `createoraclekey` to generate their oracle keypair inside the wallet
3. Send their **public key only** to the DigiByte Core maintainer
4. The maintainer adds their key to `chainparams.cpp` and ships a new release
5. The operator runs `startoracle` — the wallet provides the private key automatically

For testnet release/migration mechanics (testnet23, port 12030, RC29→RC30 cutover), follow `DIGIDOLLAR_ORACLE_SETUP.md`.

---

## Step-by-Step: For Oracle Operators

### Step 1: Compile and Run DigiByte Core (RC30+)

```bash
cd ~/Code/digibyte
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j$(nproc)
```

Start on testnet:
```bash
./src/digibyted -testnet
```

### Step 2: Create a Descriptor Wallet

Current releases create descriptor wallets by default. No special flags needed.

```bash
./src/digibyte-cli -testnet createwallet "oracle"
```

### Step 3: Generate Your Oracle Key

```bash
./src/digibyte-cli -testnet -rpcwallet=oracle createoraclekey 0
```

Replace `0` with the oracle ID slot assigned to you by the maintainer.

The mainnet chainparams `vOracleNodes` table allocates 30 metadata slots (IDs 0–29), but only slots **0–16** are part of the consensus-active MuSig2 roster (`consensus.vOraclePublicKeys`) participating in 9-of-17 consensus. Slots 17–29 are reserve placeholders and are rejected from pending-message quorum and final MuSig2 validation. Testnet23 has only the 17 active slots configured. Regtest has 7 slots (IDs 0–6) with 4-of-7 consensus.

**Output:**
```json
{
  "oracle_id": 0,
  "pubkey": "0398720f6d15252fb2c3501107d46129589d8ab56e0f967be2e470f40675eb7b57",
  "pubkey_xonly": "98720f6d15252fb2c3501107d46129589d8ab56e0f967be2e470f40675eb7b57",
  "stored_in_wallet": true,
  "message": "Oracle key generated and stored in wallet. Share ONLY the pubkey..."
}
```

**What happened:**
- A new secp256k1 keypair was generated using the wallet's secure random number generator
- The **private key** was stored securely in the wallet database (key: `oraclekey`)
- The **compressed public key** (33 bytes, 02/03 prefix) was returned for you to share
- The **x-only public key** (32 bytes, for Schnorr) was also returned

### Step 4: Send Your Public Key to the Maintainer

Send **only these two things**:
1. Your **pubkey** from the output above (66-char hex starting with `02` or `03`)
2. Your **server endpoint** (e.g., `myserver.com:12030` for testnet23, or `myserver.com:12024` for mainnet)

**⚠️ NEVER share your private key. It stays in your wallet.**

### Step 5: Wait for Updated Release

The maintainer adds your key to `chainparams.cpp` and releases an updated binary.

### Step 6: Download the Updated Binary and Start Your Oracle

```bash
# Start the node
./src/digibyted -testnet

# Start your oracle — key loads automatically from wallet!
./src/digibyte-cli -testnet -rpcwallet=oracle startoracle 0
```

**No private key argument needed.** The `startoracle` command automatically retrieves your private key from the wallet where `createoraclekey` stored it.

**Output (testnet):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "oracle_id": 0,
  "status": "running",
  "message": "Oracle started with key loaded from wallet 'oracle'"
}
```

You can also provide the key explicitly if needed:
```bash
./src/digibyte-cli -testnet startoracle 0 "raw_hex_private_key"
```

### Step 7: Verify Your Oracle is Running

```bash
# Check oracle status
./src/digibyte-cli -testnet getoraclepubkey 0

# Expected output:
# "authorized": true    ← Your key matches chainparams
# "is_running": true    ← Price thread is active
```

### Step 8: Monitor

```bash
tail -f ~/.digibyte/testnet23/debug.log | grep -i oracle
```

## What Your Oracle Does

Once running, your oracle automatically:
- Fetches DGB/USD prices from 6 active exchanges every 60 seconds (Binance, CoinGecko, KuCoin, Gate.io, HTX, Crypto.com — see `src/oracle/exchange.cpp:1013-1018`)
- Calculates median price with median-distance outlier filtering (`MultiExchangeAggregator::FilterOutliers` at `src/oracle/exchange.cpp:1150`); the live oracle daemon requires **at least 3 valid exchange responses** to publish — `OracleNode::FetchMedianPrice` overrides the aggregator's default floor of 2 (`src/oracle/node.cpp:386`, `src/oracle/exchange.h:231`)
- Signs the price with BIP-340 Schnorr using your wallet-stored private key
- Broadcasts the signed price message to the P2P network; in V1, MuSig2 bundle attestations are the consensus path

---

## Important Notes

- **Key persists in wallet** — Your oracle key survives wallet unload/reload. Since RC25, an unencrypted wallet auto-starts its oracle on load (`CWallet::TryAutoStartOracles` in `src/wallet/wallet.cpp:4797`); an encrypted wallet auto-starts after `walletpassphrase` unlock. Running `startoracle` manually after restart is still a safe fallback.
- **One key per oracle ID** — `createoraclekey` rejects if a key already exists for that ID. This prevents accidental overwrites.
- **Descriptor wallets** are the default in current releases. `dumpprivkey` exists for legacy wallets; descriptor-wallet operators do not need it because the oracle private key is stored under the `oraclekey` record (see `WriteOracleKey/ReadOracleKey` in `src/wallet/walletdb.cpp` and `StoreOracleKey/GetOracleKey` in `src/wallet/wallet.cpp`).
- **Backup your wallet** — `backupwallet` includes your oracle key. Losing the wallet means losing your oracle key.
- **P2P anti-abuse is enforced by the node** — oracle price, attestation, consensus, and MuSig2 nonce/partial-signature messages are admission checked in `src/net_processing.cpp` before relay/session ingestion. Stale MuSig2 epochs are dropped; the current and next epoch are the only accepted relay windows.

---

## Reset and Recovery

The oracle daemon is stateless beyond the wallet-resident private key plus the in-memory MuSig2 session. There is no on-disk session/secnonce store, so a clean restart cannot leak nonces. Use the steps below when the local oracle stops broadcasting, gets stuck on a stale price, or after a node restart.

### 1. Confirm the local oracle status

```bash
digibyte-cli -testnet listoracle
digibyte-cli -testnet getoraclepubkey <id>
digibyte-cli -testnet getdigidollardeploymentinfo   # check musig2_session.state for current epoch
```

Healthy output: `running=true`, `authorized=true`, and `musig2_session.state` cycles through `NONCES_COLLECTING` → `NONCES_COMPLETE` → `SIGNING` → `COMPLETE` once per epoch.

### 2. Confirm the network sees your oracle

```bash
digibyte-cli -testnet getoracles true 20 | jq '.[] | select(.is_running_locally==true)'
digibyte-cli -testnet getalloracleprices 20 | jq '.oracles[] | select(.oracle_id==<id>)'
```

Look for `price_source` values. `local` means the daemon has a fresh exchange quote; `pending` means an attestation is gossiping; `on-chain` means a recent v0x03 bundle included your slot. `none` plus `status=no_data` for several blocks means the daemon is not contributing — go to step 3.

### 3. Restart cleanly

```bash
digibyte-cli -testnet stoporacle <id>
digibyte-cli -testnet -rpcwallet=oracle walletpassphrase "<passphrase>" 600   # encrypted wallets only
digibyte-cli -testnet -rpcwallet=oracle startoracle <id>
```

`stoporacle` joins the price thread and clears pending oracle-message state; `startoracle` rebuilds the price thread from the wallet-resident key. A full daemon restart drops in-memory MuSig2 sessions, and the current-epoch session is recreated lazily on the next remote nonce or block tick (see `OracleSigningOrchestrator::OnBlockConnected`). Pre-restart secnonce material is unrecoverable by design — a recreated session generates fresh nonces.

### 4. Diagnose exchange-feed issues

The live oracle requires **3 of 6 exchange responses** to publish (see "What Your Oracle Does" above). Search the debug log for fetcher errors:

```bash
tail -n 2000 ~/.digibyte/testnet23/debug.log | grep -E "Oracle: (Insufficient|Exception|Failed to fetch|Initialized)"
```

Specifically:
- `Oracle: Insufficient price sources (N < 3 required)` — fewer than 3 exchanges responded; check outbound HTTPS, DNS, and CA bundle path.
- `Oracle: Exception fetching from <Exchange>` — that exchange's API or the local TLS path failed for that round.
- `Oracle: WARNING - 5 consecutive price fetch failures` / `ALERT - 15` / `CRITICAL - %d` — escalating reachability problems (`src/oracle/node.cpp:362-377`).
- `HttpGet: SECURITY - No CA bundle found` — your host has no recognized system CA store; install `ca-certificates` (Debian/Ubuntu) or equivalent so libcurl can verify TLS.

A single broken endpoint (bad URL or quota-blocked) is non-fatal; the round logs the per-fetcher error and proceeds with the remaining sources as long as ≥3 succeed. There is no API-key configuration: the daemon uses only public unauthenticated endpoints, so missing-key is not a startup failure mode.

### 5. Recover from wallet corruption

If the wallet DB is unreadable, the oracle key is gone. There is no on-chain way to rotate keys without a chainparams update.

- Restore the wallet from `backupwallet` if one exists; the `oraclekey` record carries the private key.
- Otherwise, run `createoraclekey <id>` to generate a new key, send the new pubkey to the maintainer, and wait for the next release before resuming as that slot. Until the chainparams update ships, the slot stays inactive.

## For the Maintainer: Adding an Operator's Key

When an operator sends you their 33-byte compressed public key, add it to **two places** in `src/kernel/chainparams.cpp`:

### 1. vOracleNodes (33-byte compressed CPubKey)

In `InitializeOracleNodes()` — match the network's P2P port (mainnet 12024, testnet23 12030):
```cpp
{5, ParsePubKey("0398720f6d15252fb2c3501107d46129589d8ab56e0f967be2e470f40675eb7b57"), "operator.server.com:12030", true},
```

### 2. consensus.vOraclePublicKeys (32-byte x-only key — strip the 02/03 prefix)

```cpp
consensus.vOraclePublicKeys.push_back("98720f6d15252fb2c3501107d46129589d8ab56e0f967be2e470f40675eb7b57");
```

**⚠️ Both locations must be updated.** `vOracleNodes` uses 33-byte compressed keys. `consensus.vOraclePublicKeys` uses 32-byte x-only keys. They must match.

Then recompile and distribute the updated binary.

## Oracle Slots

| Network | Total Slots | Active (in MuSig2 quorum) | Consensus | Notes |
|---------|------------|---------------------------|-----------|-------|
| Mainnet | 30 (IDs 0–29) | 17 (slots 0–16) | 9-of-17 MuSig2 (RC30) | DigiDollar/MuSig2 activates at BIP9 min height 22,014,720. Slots 17–29 stay reserve placeholders after activation: they are *not* in `consensus.vOraclePublicKeys` and `ValidateMuSig2Bundle` rejects any signer with `id ≥ 17`. Promoting a reserve to active requires a chainparams change in a future release (see `DD-FA-ARCH-001`). |
| Testnet (testnet23) | 17 (IDs 0–16) | 17 (slots 0–16) | 9-of-17 MuSig2 (RC30) | Active from height 600. Testnet has no reserve slots configured. |
| Regtest | 7 (IDs 0–6) | 7 | 4-of-7 MuSig2 | Always active. |

To confirm a slot is in the active quorum at runtime, call
`getoracles` and inspect the `in_consensus` field, or call
`getdigidollardeploymentinfo` and read `oracle_pubkey_count` /
`oracle_total_slots`. A slot is in the active quorum iff
`oracle_id < oracle_pubkey_count`.
